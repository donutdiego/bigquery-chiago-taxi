This code is a series of SQL queries that retrieve and analyze data on Chicago taxi trips from the BigQuery public dataset.

The first query calculates the average trip miles per hour for each hour of the day, which can provide insight into the busiest times for taxi trips.

The second query calculates the average trip cost, tips, and duration for each hour of the day and each day of the week, which can provide more detailed information on when and how much people are spending on taxi trips.

The third query selects training data for a machine learning model that will predict trip cost based on various features such as trip duration, day of the week, and time of day.

The fourth query creates the machine learning model, specifying that it is a linear regression model and the target variable is trip total cost.

The fifth query uses the created model to predict trip total cost based on the same features as the training data, limited to a sample of 25,000 rows.

Overall, this code demonstrates the use of BigQuery and SQL to explore and analyze data, as well as to build and train a machine learning regression model.
