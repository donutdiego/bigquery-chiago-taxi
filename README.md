This code is a series of SQL queries that retrieve and analyze data on Chicago taxi trips from the BigQuery public dataset.

The first query calculates the average trip miles per hour for each hour of the day, which can provide insight into the busiest times for taxi trips.

The second query calculates the average trip cost, tips, and duration for each hour of the day and each day of the week, which can provide more detailed information on when and how much people are spending on taxi trips.

The third query selects training data for a machine learning model that will predict trip cost based on various features such as trip duration, day of the week, and time of day.

The fourth query creates the machine learning model, specifying that it is a linear regression model and the target variable is trip total cost.

The fifth query uses the created model to predict trip total cost based on the same features as the training data, limited to a sample of 25,000 rows.

Overall, this code demonstrates the use of BigQuery and SQL to explore and analyze data, as well as to build and train a machine learning regression model.

**Can this BigQuery Linear Regression Model Predict Chicago Taxi Trip Costs?**

As the ridesharing industry continues to grow, taxi companies are turning to data-driven approaches to optimize pricing, reduce costs, and improve customer experiences. In this context, building accurate predictive models for taxi trip costs is a critical task.

In this project, we built a linear regression model using BigQuery to predict the cost of Chicago taxi trips. The model was trained on a dataset containing trip information from 2020 to 2022, including trip duration, day of the week, and hour of the day. We used evaluation metrics such as mean absolute error, mean squared error, and R-squared to assess the model's performance.

The results of our model were mixed. The mean absolute error was 6.835, indicating that on average, our model's predictions were off by around $7. The median absolute error of 3.2974 suggests that the model is better at predicting some trips than others, but overall its predictions tend to be somewhat inaccurate. The R-squared value of 0.0479 indicates that the model explains only a small amount of the variance in the target variable, and could benefit from additional features or more complex modeling techniques.

Overall, we can conclude that our model has some predictive power, but there is definitely room for improvement. Expanding the date range of the training data, adding new features, or trying more complex modeling techniques could help to improve the model's accuracy and predictive power.

This project demonstrates how BigQuery can be used to build predictive models for taxi trip costs, and highlights some of the challenges and limitations of linear regression models. By continuing to refine our models and improve our understanding of taxi trip costs, we can help taxi companies to optimize their pricing strategies, reduce costs, and provide better experiences for customers.
